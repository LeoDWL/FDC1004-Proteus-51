# FDC1004-Proteus-51
Recently, I helped undergraduates to do a graduation project. I simulated the process of water content detection of crude oil on Proteus, and detected the capacitance value of the capacitive sensor through FDC1004, and then obtained the final water content and displayed it according to the fitting relationship between the water content and the capacitance value.
